# CO2 EMISSION PREDICTION - REGRESSION


# **PROBLEM STATEMENT :**
## To predict the CO2 emissions (g/km) from a vehicle in Canada depending on the fuel consumption and other describing features of a vehicle.


# **DATASET :**

The dataset has been taken from the Canada Government official website link is given below.
https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64#wb-auto-6

This dataset provide model-specific fuel consumption in (L/100 km) and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada over the period of  **2010-2023** .


# **RESEARCH QUESTION**

**1.** The determine or test the influence of different variables  Engine Size, Cylinder, Transmission, Fuel Type and Fuel Consumption on the emission of CO2.

**2.** Will there be any effect on the CO2 emissions prediction model when Fuel Consumption for City and Highway are considered separately and when their weighted variable interaction is considered?

**3.** What are the most important features of a vehicle on which CO2 emissions depend the most?
